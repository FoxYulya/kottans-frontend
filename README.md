# 0. Git-intro

It's all new to me and I'm really excited to learn new things, especially about Git, because I don't use it very often in my projects, and all this Git stuff has always been difficult for me, and I wanted to understand what is happening here from the very beginning.

# 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP

Everything in this lesson was relatively new to me.
I was surprised that the Linux OS is so powerful and at the same time easy to learn. The commands may seem complicated at first, but they are actually quite simple.
I don't use Linux in my daily life, but I'm sure I'll be using these commands that I've already learned in the Git Bash terminal.
